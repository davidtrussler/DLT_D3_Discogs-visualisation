# D3 Discogs Visualisation

New project based on an [earlier visualisation of Discogs data](https://github.com/davidtrussler/DLT_D3_Discogs) and stuff learned from following Scott Murrayâ€™s book, [Interactive Data Visualisation for the Web](https://github.com/davidtrussler/DLT_D3_Interactive-DV).

The first goal is to create a bar chart that shows the categories in my record collection enumerated against each other.

Following that I would expect to extend this to allow further investigation of my collection in other ways, yet to be decided.
