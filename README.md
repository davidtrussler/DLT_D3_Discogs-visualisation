# DLT_D3_Discogs-visualisation

New project based on an earlier visualisation of Discogs data and stuff learned from following Scott Murrayâ€™s book, Interactive Data Visualisation for the Web.

The first goal is to create a bar chart that shows the categories in my record collection enumerated against each other.

Following that I would expect to extend this to allow further investigation of my collection in other ways, yet to be decided.
